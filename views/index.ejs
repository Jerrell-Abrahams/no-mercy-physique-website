                    me throughout my weight-loss journey. I've learned to
                    preserve and to keep going; Coach Sherry, I thank you.
                    You've taught me about controlling my intake,
                    accountability, and how to prepare and eat my meals; I will
                    always love you for it. Exercise and what you eat go hand in

                    weight, discouraged, dispondent and depressed. The coaches
                    reminded me how I could push myself and persevere to
                    overcome what I was feeling. I realized that with hard work
                    and determination I could reach my goals. I was an athlete
                    in school but after years of inactivity I struggled to lose
                    weight. With NMP I regained my confidence. I changed my
                    lifestyle and I am still working on attaining my goal,but I
                    have certainly come a long way. Thanks to my coaches and
                    teammates that encourage and motivate me to push myself just
                    a little further than I thought I could. I am blessed to be
                    part of the team. The Coaches are hands on and really make

                    My goal was to build muscle and my self-esteem; our coaches
                    did just that. Coach Sherry is the encourager of the team;
                    she pushes us to levels that I never thought were possible."
