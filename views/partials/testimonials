                      Here at Bored Panda, we decided to compile a list of
                      people who bulked up big-time and barely look like the
                      same people in their 'before' photos, from women fitness
                      maniacs to guys who have managed to get ripped using no
                      exercise equipment at all. We've also included the
                      timespan of their progress, but keep in mind that everyone
                      builds at a different pace!
